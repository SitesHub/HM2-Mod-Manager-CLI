# Hotline Miami 2 Mod Manager CLI

This is a Mod Manager designed to install, uninstall mods for Hotline miami 2 without the hastle of going back and forth with folders.

## How it works

Basically when you want to play a new level/campaign, you'll only need to put the .patchwad's and .wad's files in the same folder that the batch file is in and it'll do the work for you.

## How to set it up properly

You'll need 2 paths:
1. The path that leads to the _**game's main folder**_ ;
2. The path where you have stored the _**music file**_ ( .wad ) ;

To set them, just use the following parameters: 
```
/s        for the first
/s /b     for the second
```

Or you could set them by using the built-in "**GUI**", just click the .bat file like any executable.
